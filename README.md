# Bag of Words Model for Text Classification
This project implements a Bag of Words model to classify text data.

# Features
- **Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and removal of stopwords.**
- **Vectorization: Conversion of text to numerical vectors using Bag of Words.**
- **Model Training: Training a machine learning model on the vectorized text.**
- **Evaluation: Assessing model performance on test data.**

# Usage

**1. Preprocess the data:**
- **Load the dataset.**
- **Clean the text by removing non-letter characters.**
- **Convert text to lowercase.**
- **Split the text into individual words.**
- **Remove common words that do not carry much meaning (like "the", "is", "in").**
- **Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").**
- **Create a list of cleaned and processed text.**

**2.Vectorize the text:
- **Transform the list of processed text into numerical vectors that represent the frequency of each word.**

**3.Train the model:**
- **Split the data into training and testing sets.**
- **Train a machine learning model using the training data.**
- **Predict the labels for the testing data.**
- **Evaluate the model's accuracy by comparing predicted labels with actual labels.**
